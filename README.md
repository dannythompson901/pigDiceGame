# pigDiceGame
This is my version of the Pig Dice Game. Alot of time went into this to make sure it functioned the way I wanted.

Rules
Players roll a dice back and forth. 
Points are equal to the numeric value shown on the dice. i.e. if you roll a 4 you have 4 points.
You only KEEP the points you SAVE. 
If you roll a 1, you will lose all of your unsaved points for that round. Your turn will end. This begins the next players turn.
First to 20 wins. 

If you want a longer game change the code on line 57 of the pigGame.js file from 20 to whatever number you want. Traditionally the game goes to 100.
